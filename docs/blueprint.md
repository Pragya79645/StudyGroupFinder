## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 70%, 50% (RGB hex: #3399FF). Evokes trust, intelligence, and focus, which is perfect for a study environment. It's also vibrant enough to be engaging without being distracting.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 98% (RGB hex: #F5FAFF). Provides a soft, clean backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 60%, 40% (RGB hex: #33CCCC). A refreshing and contrasting hue that draws attention to key interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look
- Use clean, outline-style icons to represent subjects, skills, and exam types. Icons should be easily recognizable and consistent in style.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear sections for profile information, group lists, and chat rooms. Prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations for UI transitions, such as loading screens and message notifications. Animations should be smooth and unobtrusive.
